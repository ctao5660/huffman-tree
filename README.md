Huffman Compression is a tree based compression with simple AI involved which takes the number of times a character is repeated into consideration when assigning values to letters. We then traverse a binary tree, assigning the path of the tree as the "code word" that will represent the word in our compression(0 for left of tree, 1 for right), where the closer characters to the top of the tree are the ones with the larger frequency. Once all the code words have been created the resulting file can be decoded by using the decoder file which takes in a file that has the tree inside it.
